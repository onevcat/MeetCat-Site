## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.5]

Auto updating support is now integrated for the macOS desktop app, with user-visible prompts across tray, settings, and overlay before installation.

### Added

- Added auto updating support for the macOS app, including startup/daily checks, tray/settings/overlay prompts, release notes, and explicit user-confirmed installation.

### Changed

- Changed stale-homepage recovery to detect wake-from-sleep and trigger controlled homepage refresh after wake.
- Changed stale-homepage policy to force refresh after long unchanged sessions (foreground included) for better overnight/session-long reliability.

### Fixed

- Fixed homepage freshness handling to reduce stale meeting lists during long-running sessions and after system wake.

## [0.0.4] - 2026-02-09

A reliability-focused release for homepage freshness and long-running stability across both the Chrome extension and the macOS app.

### Added

- macOS app menu now includes a Refresh Home command with Cmd+R, and the Meet homepage listens for the shortcut.

### Changed

- Homepage stale recovery now uses a fingerprint-based watchdog with foreground-aware behavior: while the homepage is focused, reloads are deferred until the tab or window loses focus.
- Repeated stale states now use exponential backoff (30 → 60 → 120 minutes) with a daily reload cap, improving stability without causing refresh loops.

### Fixed

- Auto-join now stops once the meeting is entered, preventing countdowns from persisting or triggering an unintended leave click.
- Homepage meeting list refreshes are more reliable, with background-triggered updates and automatic recovery after repeated parse failures.
- Long-idle and cross-day homepage sessions now recover automatically when meeting data remains unchanged for too long, reducing cases where stale meeting lists persist.

## [0.0.3] - 2026-02-05

Improves homepage meeting parsing reliability and meeting close detection.

### Changed
- Homepage meeting parsing now derives display time from the meeting start time and uses aria-label text when titles are missing, making it more resilient to Meet UI changes.
- Hidden or aria-hidden meeting cards are ignored so overlays only reflect visible meetings.

### Fixed
- Meeting close is reported on page hide so suppression state updates reliably when leaving a meeting.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-02-04

First public release of MeetCat for Chrome and macOS.

### Added
- Chrome extension with homepage overlays, auto-join scheduling, and a settings popup.
- macOS Tauri desktop app with tray controls, auto-join support, and a full settings window.
- Join countdown overlay plus a separate homepage overlay with hide controls.
- Meeting suppression handling and smarter joinable meeting selection.
- Optional developer log collection controls.

### Changed
- Overlay icon now uses the MeetCat icon instead of the personal avatar.

### Fixed
- WebView script re-injection on page load to prevent missing overlays.
- Meeting links now open correctly in the intended browser or webview.
- Overlay z-index and settings window scrolling glitches.
